### Operators
- binary operators have no definite order ( X + Y) // x or y may be evaluated first
- comma operator (,):
    - evaluated from left to right
    - the last evaluation is returned
- compound assignment: += , -= , *=, &= ....
- assignment (=) returns the variable itself
- associativity:  left-to-right(+,-), or right-to-left (=)
- order of evaluation:  X + Y  (we don't know whether X is evaluated first or Y.
- and  (p ^ q)   or is upside-down, not (~)
